# Takeda

* Many of his attacks are similar to Scorpion's  
* Long range fighter  
* At a disadvantage in close-range because basic attacks are slower than most opponents'  
* Use combos and throws to knock opponent away, then assault from a distance  

Takeda was trained by Scorpion and the Shirai Ryu so many of his attacks will remind you of Scorpion, 
especially if you use the Shirai Ryu variation. However, no matter which variation you choose, Takeda 
is a long-range fighter first and foremost. If you're close to an opponent you'll be at a slight 
disadvantage because many of Takeda's basic attacks are slower than most of the other characters in 
Mortal Kombat X. Use combos and throws to knock the opponent away and then continue to assault them 
from a distance.
